description: Global Historical Climate Network includes daily land surface observations
  from around the world. The GHCN-Daily was developed to meet the needs of climate
  analysis and monitoring studies that require data at a sub-monthly time resolution
  (e.g., assessments of the frequency of heavy rainfall, heat wave duration, etc.).
  The dataset includes observations from World Meteorological Organization, Cooperative,
  and CoCoRaHS networks. If observed, the station dataset includes max and minimum
  temperatures, total precipitation, snowfall, and depth of snow on ground. Some U.S.
  station data are typically delayed only 24 hours.
